    			I'm holding my bachelor in mechanical engineering ⚙️ and I've worked in various sales & marketing positions at Philip Morris International for almost 5 years. Indeed, I've decided to resign from my comfort zone to join Digital Marketing & Data Science 💻 master's program at Emlyon Business School in France. I'm a multidisciplinary, open-minded, joyful and data-driven individual who tries to understand this world in a proper way. I'm originally from Turkey but I consider myself as a humble world citizen 🌍✈️.
